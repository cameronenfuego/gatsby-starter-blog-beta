description: First post in getting used to this platform. It's odd swallowing a void, being Jesus. But we're kind of on this journey together.

Unceremonious. That's how I'd describe this platform and this post. Fitting for this year. I'm not mad at it, honestly. I kind of like the understated nature of this for now. I get ahead of myself. Welcome to this new journey—really not sure how long it'll last.

While we're on this journey, I'm going by Brooklyn Jesus or Jesus of Brooklyn and I prefer he/they pronouns. I'll get into those later. I'm not certain what I want to talk about here, but I know that faith, religion, gender identity, sexual identity, and politics to a degree will likely be the main topics—I think I'm biting off more than I can chew.

I hope some of you will read along as I explore what I feel needs exploring here. Yes, this is a self-guided, self-fulfilling journey—narcissistic—but I don't intend it to be solely masturbatory.

Welcome. You—_all_ of you—are welcome here. You may have heard that the travelers are many and the road is narrow. However, I say to you that the travelers are not as many as I'd prefer, as far as I can see, and the road is wide. So come.

Until next time,
Jesus
